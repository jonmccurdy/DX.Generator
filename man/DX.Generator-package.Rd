  DX.Generator implements the DX-class of RNG as a user-supplied generator in R, accessible with \code{runif()}
}
\description{
This package implements the DX-class of Psuedo-Random Number Generators which are very efficient and have nice empirical properties. When it comes to Random Number Generators, R currently provides seven different generators which are built-in; the default being the MT-19937 generator which has not passed all empirical tests. Users are able to select the DX-class of generators, which has passed all empirical test, as the user-supplied generator as well as choose the order of the linear recurrence as well as number of non-zero coefficients in the MRG by using the function.
}
\details{
  Users can set the DX-class of RNGs as the default generator in R by using the dx_init() function.
  Additionally, \code{dx_init(K=47, S=1)} will allow users to specify the K and S values for the generator.
