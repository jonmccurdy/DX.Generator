Description: Implements the DX-class of Psuedo-Random Number Generators which are very efficient and have nice empirical properties. When it comes to Random Number Generators, R currently provides seven different generators which are built-in; the default being the MT-19937 generator which has not passed all empirical tests. Users are able to select the DX-class of generators, which has passed all empirical tests, as the user-supplied generator as well as choose the order of the linear recurrence as well as number of non-zero coefficients in the MRG by using the function.
