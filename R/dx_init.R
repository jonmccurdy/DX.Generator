#' @description 
#' \code{dx_init()} allows the user to designate the DX-class of Pseudo-Random Number Generators 
#' as the user-supplied RNG in R. This makes it so where \code{runif()} and any other function 
#' relying on \code{runif()} will use a DX-k-s RNG to generate the random variate. 
#' 
#' @details 
#' Within this function there are two arguments which can be passed through the function.
#' \eqn{K} determines the order of the linear occurrence, and \eqn{S} determines the number of non-zero 
#' coefficients in the MRG. 
#' 
#' Speed is the fastest for the default values of \eqn{S}, that is \eqn{S = 1}.  
#' The argument \eqn{K} has no affect on the speed of the generator. The argument \eqn{S} essentially 
#' controls how many additions are performed to produce the next random number: the fewer, the faster.
#' 
#' Although DX-\eqn{k}-\eqn{s} generators have excellent empirical properties and can pass the most 
#' stringent battery of tests for uniformity, those set with \eqn{s = 4} will appear marginally more 
#' randomly and uniformly distributed. 
#' 
#' Often times in simulations, a consecutive run of random numbers need to appear independent with 
#' small serial correlations between any successive subset of numbers.  If \eqn{j} consecutive 
#' numbers need to appear independent, then choose argument \eqn{K} such that \eqn{K > j}.
#' 
#' @param K the order of the linear recurrence. \eqn{K} must be an integer between 5 and 50,000
#' @param S number of non-zero coefficients in the MRG. \eqn{S} must be an either 1,2,3 or 4
